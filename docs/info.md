## How it works

The design generates and stores a perfect maze on-chip using a compact binary-tree maze generator by default.
The maze is shown live while it is being built, so walls can visibly change during the reveal.
After generation finishes, the player controls the green dot while a single wall-following solver can race as well.

## Controls

- D-pad: move the player
- A: start or stop the solver
- B: reset player and solver positions
- SELECT: generate a new maze
- START: speed up generation while the maze is still being built

## How to test

Connect VGA and the PMOD gamepad, then reset the design and play the maze game.
Press SELECT to generate a fresh maze and START during generation to accelerate the live build animation.

## External hardware

A PMOD gamepad and VGA are required.
